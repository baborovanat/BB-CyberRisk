# BB-CyberRisk

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes the cybersecurity threats facing Banco do Brasil, one of the largest financial institutions in Latin America. The study focuses on six key threat objectives: **extortion, watering hole attacks, financial fraud, sabotage, data disclosure, and resource hijacking**.  

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- **Extortion** (e.g., ransomware) poses a severe risk due to the bank's reliance on digital transactions.  
- **Financial Fraud** (e.g., phishing, identity theft) remains a constant threat despite advanced security measures.  
- **Data Disclosure** is a major concern, with strict regulatory penalties under Brazil’s LGPD.  
- **Sabotage & Resource Hijacking** have lower likelihood but still require monitoring and mitigation.  

## 🚀 Cybersecurity Strategy Priorities  
1. **Strengthen data protection** – Implement robust encryption & multi-factor authentication.  
2. **Enhance threat detection** – Invest in AI-driven monitoring and anomaly detection.  
3. **Improve incident response** – Rapid containment and recovery strategies for cyber threats.  
4. **Security awareness training** – Reduce human-related vulnerabilities through education.  

## 🛠 Red Team Table Top Exercise (TTX)  
This project also includes a **Red Team TTX**, simulating cyber attack scenarios such as phishing and malware infections. The exercise is based on real-world cases like the **Grandoreiro banking trojan**, demonstrating Banco do Brasil’s susceptibility to financial fraud.
